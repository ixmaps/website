    <p>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>To install and run IXmaps Traceroute Generator version 0.8.6 for Windows, you must be running as Administrator.  The
       traceroute algorithm used usually completes within 10 seconds.
    <p>IXmaps Traceroute Generator version 0.8.6 for MacOSX is available as a tarball.  You need to have root
       privileges to install the program correctly.  When running the program, the PATH enviroment variable
       must point to the directory which contains the tr-sub and wmtrcmd binary executables.  To run the program,
       just invoke tr-sub without any command-line arguments.
    <p>IXmaps Traceroute Generator version 0.8.6 for Linux is available as a tarball.  You need to have root
       privileges to install the program correctly.   The program will reside in /usr/local/bin .
    <p>
    <p>To install and run IXmaps Traceroute Generator version 0.8.5 for Windows, no Administrator privileges are required.
       The Windows &quot;tracert&quot; program is used, and my take up to 6 minutes to do a single traceroute
       if no response is received from the destination host.
    <p>
    <p>Other than the traceroute algorithm used, the two versions are identical.  You may minimize the
       windows while the program is running.
    <p>For Windows, when asked to do a full or custom install, pick the full install.
    <p>
    <h3>Changes from 0.8.3/0.8.4</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The server is accessed as trgen.ixmaps.ca to allow www.ixmaps.ca to be in a separate location.</li>
      <li>Limited support for MacOS X (Tiger or later) and recent GNU/Linux.</li>
      <li>Fixed race condition bug that caused the program to occasionally hang when completing a traceroute.</li>
      <li>Traceroutes that contain routing loops are discarded.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Changes from 0.8.1/0.8.2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Traceroute status page displays a table with a row for each traceroute done.  The columns are:
        <ul>
          <li>The hostname or dotted-quad IP address.</li>
          <li>The number of hosts along the traceroute path that replied/the total number of hops on the path.</li>
          <li>The elapsed time in seconds to do the entire traceroute to the host.</li>
          <li>The ID of the traceroute in the IXmaps database, or an error message in red.  A yellow ID means that
              the traceroute destination host itself did not reply.</li>
        </ul>
        The latest host or batch done is in bold.</li> 
      <li>Data entry fields accept the Enter key.</li>
      <li>The program version number appears on the title bar.</li>
      <li>The progress dialog is embedded into the Traceroute Running page instead of being a
          separate pop-up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If there is temporarily high latency between your computer and the central database, you may get
    a &quot;The connection to the central database is not working.&quot; pop-up.  The TrGen client
    program waits 5 seconds after it sends a traceroute result to the server.  If the confirmation
    is not received within that time, the pop-up will appear.  Often, the data will have made it
    into the database.
