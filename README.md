# IXmaps website
================

This repo contains *most* of what we use for the ixmaps website. Certain pieces of content have been omitted, notably videos and documents. Additionally, we have chosen not to include the Maxmind Geodata in the repo. In order to duplicate this repo locally, you'll need to do the following:
- create a application/geoip/dat/ folder
- add GeoIPASNum.dat, GeoIP.dat, GeoIPv6.dat, GeoLiteCity.dat, GeoLiteCityv6.dat
These files can be downloaded from the Maxmind developers website (https://dev.maxmind.com/)
