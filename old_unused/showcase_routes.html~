<h3 id="NSA">NSA listening posts</h3>
<p>Description: The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) warrantless surveillance controversy
was brought to light by former AT&T technician Mark Klein. Klein claims that several
internet service providers (ISPs) in the States have allowed the NSA to install devices
which mirror all traffic passing through selected routers. This copied data is then
inspected by Narus computers and routed back to NSA headquarters. Klein has described in
detail a 'secret spy room" at 611 Folsom St. in San Francisco - Room 641A - and knows of
other such rooms in Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, San Jose and Atlanta (see his book:
Wiring Up The Big Brother Machine... And Fighting It, p.98). The NSA is strongly
suspected of having installed a total of 15-20 similar spy rooms at major internet
exchange points across the country (e.g. Chicago, New York). View a map of these
suspected NSA splitter locations.<p>

Thanks to former AT&T technical Mark Klein, the best documented NSA eavesdropping site is
at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA.

View a map of a traceroute from a home in
Toronto to the San Francisco Art Institute that passes through AT&T's internet switching
facility at  611 Folsom (TR#1859).</a> Note that this traceroute also goes through Chicago,
another suspected site of NSA eavesdropping.

<h3 id="Sovereignty">Canadian network sovereignty ("boomerang routes")</h3>
<p>Description: due to current technical, economic and policy choices made principally by private corporations, Canadian internet traffic is often routed through the US.
Thus, packets originating in Ottawa and terminating in Winnipeg may pass through routers in New York and Chicago before reaching their destination.
This is sometimes referred to as a "boomerang route," and freqently occurs despite the fact that the total distance of the route is longer through the US than through Canada.
These boomerang routes have prompted concerns regarding Canadian network sovereignty, where Canadian packets passing through routers in the US may be
subject to unknown types of inspection or filtering.</p>
