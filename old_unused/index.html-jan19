    <p>IXmaps is  an interactive tool under development that will permit Internet users to see  the route that their Internet data packets take across North  America. When the user enters a destination URL in their browser  they see in an adjacent window, a map of North America  on which the packets’ routes will be displayed. Each ‘exchange point’ or  ‘carrier hotel’ along that route is displayed in Google Earth as a labelled  highlighted icon. When the icon is clicked, a balloon appears containing an  HTML document with information about that interchange point and the building  where it is physically located. This includes a photo of the building, its  ownership, ISPs and other facilities within it and known links or alliances  among the building owners, clients, and government or corporate entities.  Examples are the building at 151  Front Street, Toronto  or the multi-story tower called One Wilshire in Los  Angeles. Clickable icons are color-coded and an overlay  with a legend is shown which contains a brief summary of the route and exchange  points traversed. In the Google Earth ‘Places panel’, an ordered list of  traceroute hops with IP addresses and AS numbers is displayed.</p>

    <p>The projects most similar in scope to IXmaps are the <a href="http://www.netdimes.org/new/" target="1">DIMES</a> project from Tel Aviv University, <a href="http://www.kahunaburger.com/2009/03/28/google-earth-as-a-traceroute-viewer/">kahunaburger traceroute</a>,  the <a href="http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/gtrace" target="1">Gtrace</a> project, the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geotrace/" target="1">Geographical Traceroute</a> project, and the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/xtraceroute" target="1">xtraceroute</a> project. IXmaps is distinct from all of these projects as it employs a  unique traceroute visualization from the user's system to the  destination (displayed in Google Earth) and presents unique information  about Internet exchange points transited along the way. These  developments are being implemented with funding from the SSHRC ITST  program. IXmaps is part of the New Transparency Project at the Faculty  of Information, University of Toronto. The project team consists of Dr.  David J. Phillips, Associate Professor and Chair of Doctoral Studies,  Faculty of Information and Dr. Andrew Clement, Professor, Faculty of  Information and Coordinator, <a href="http://iprp.ischool.utoronto.ca/" target="1">Information Policy Research Program</a> as well as Dr. Nancy Paterson, Associate Professor, Ontario College of Art &amp; Design.</p>
