    <p>IXmaps
is an interactive tool under development that will permit Internet
users to see the route that their Internet data packets take across
North America. When the user enters a destination URL in their browser
they see in an adjacent window, a map of North America on which the
packets’ routes will be displayed. Each ‘exchange point’ or ‘carrier
hotel’ along that route is displayed in Google Earth as a labelled
highlighted icon. When the icon is clicked, a balloon appears
containing an HTML document with information about that interchange
point and the building where it is physically located. This includes a
photo of the building, its ownership, ISPs and other facilities within
it and known links or alliances among the building owners, clients, and
government or corporate entities. Examples are the building at 151
Front Street, Toronto or the multi-story tower called One Wilshire in
Los Angeles. Clickable icons are color-coded and an overlay with a
legend is shown which contains a brief summary of the route and
exchange points traversed. In the Google Earth ‘Places panel’, an
ordered list of traceroute hops with IP addresses and AS numbers is
displayed. </p>

    <p>The projects most similar in scope to IXmaps are the 
      <a href="http://www.netdimes.org/new/" target="1">DIMES</a> project
      from Tel Aviv University,
      <a href="http://www.kahunaburger.com/2009/03/28/google-earth-as-a-traceroute-viewer/">kahunaburger traceroute</a>,
      the <a href="http://www.caida.org/tools/visualization/gtrace" target="1">Gtrace</a> project,
      the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geotrace/" target="1">Geographical Traceroute</a> project,
      and the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/xtraceroute" target="1">xtraceroute</a>
project. IXmaps is distinct from all of these projects as it employs a
unique traceroute visualization from the user's system to the
destination (displayed in Google Earth) and presents unique information
about Internet exchange points transited along the way. These
developments are being implemented with funding from the SSHRC ITST
program. IXmaps is part of the New Transparency Project at the Faculty
of Information, University of Toronto. The project team consists of Dr.
David J. Phillips, Associate Professor and Chair of Doctoral Studies,
Faculty of Information and Dr. Andrew Clement, Professor, Faculty of
Information and Coordinator, <a href="http://iprp.ischool.utoronto.ca/" target="1">Information Policy Research Program</a>
as well as Dr. Nancy Paterson, Associate Professor, Ontario College of Art &amp; Design.</p>

The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), is strongly suspected of having installed ‘splitter rooms’ in 15-20 major internet exchange points.

Thanks to former AT&T technical Mark Klein, the best documented NSA eavesdropping site is at 611 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA.

Note that this traceroute also goes through Chicago, another suspected site of NSA eavesdropping.
