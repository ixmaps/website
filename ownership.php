			<h2>Connections Through IXPs with Interesting Ownership</h2>
			<p>Description:Â  A &ldquo;carrier hotel&rdquo; is an office building that is    tailored to  network operators. These
buildings and data centers are where internet  traffic changes hands from one network to another.    Carrier hotels have  separate real estate &lsquo;owners&rsquo; and
technical &lsquo;operators&rsquo; for the  inter-networking taking place inside. Typically    they are owned by large  public and private equity real-estate holding
 companies such as Hines  REIT (Real Estate investment trust), Carlyle    (CRG West - Carlyle Real  Estate West) and Digital Realty Trust.</p>

              <p>Another example of a carrier hotel with interesting ownership is the NAP of the Americas in Miami. This data center is one of the major
gateways for traffic to and from South and Central America. The site is owned by Terremark a carrier hotel operator, who have been recently acquired by Verizon which is a
large backbone operator. Since Verizon acquired Terremark people are wondering if we should be concerned that this incumbent backbone operator may have other plans regarding
internet traffic control.</p>
